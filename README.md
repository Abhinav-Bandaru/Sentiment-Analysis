# Sentiment-Analysis

This project involved peforming sentiment analysis on twitter reviews. The dataset used contains 99,989 tweets.

Using Regular Expressions, a function was defined to preprocess the data and get rid of tags, hashtags, URLs, Special Characters and other information, unnecessary to perform analysis.

Next a function was defined to remove the stopwords from the twitter reviews using the inbuilt set of stopwords.

Then the dataset was visualized using wordcloud.

Then 2 functions were defined to perform subjectivity and polarity on the tweets. And based on the on the polarity of the tweet, it was classified into Positive, Negative or Neutral.
